	<h1>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</h1>

	<p>From western Philadelphia I hail <br>
	where in my youth I'd play upon the green <br>
	'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd <br>
	by ruffians contemptible and mean. <br>
	Although the spat was trivial and brief, <br>
	it wounded my dear mother deep within; <br>
	and so, to give her conscience sweet relief, <br>
	she sent me forth to live amongst her kin. <br>
	When to my port of call I'd been conveyed, <br>
	I came upon a coachman most unique; <br>
	and yet, I simply took the trip and paid, <br>
	despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique. <br>
	I survey all the land with princely mien <br>
	in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene. <br>
	</p>
